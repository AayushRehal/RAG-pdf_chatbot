# RAG-pdf_chatbot

RAG-pdf_chatbot is an intelligent chatbot system designed to answer questions based on the content of PDF documents. It leverages the cutting-edge Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, which combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to enable efficient and accurate question-answering. By ingesting PDF files, the chatbot can understand and retrieve relevant information from the documents, allowing users to engage in natural language conversations and receive precise responses. This repository provides the implementation of the RAG-pdf_chatbot, including data preprocessing, model training, and deployment scripts. It aims to facilitate information retrieval from PDF documents, enhancing productivity and streamlining research across various domains.
